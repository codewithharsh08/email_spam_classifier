# 📧 Email Spam Classifier

A machine learning-based web app that classifies email messages as **Spam** or **Not Spam (Ham)** using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. It uses text preprocessing, TF-IDF vectorization, and classification models like Logistic Regression to make predictions.

## 🚀 Features

- ✂️ **NLP Preprocessing**: Clean text, remove stopwords, lowercase, etc.
- 🔤 **TF-IDF Vectorization**: Transform raw email text into numerical features
- 🧠 **Spam Detection** using:
  - Logistic Regression (default)
  - Easily extendable to Naive Bayes, SVM, etc.
- ⚡ **Real-time Predictions** from user input
- 📊 **Accuracy & Evaluation Metrics**: Precision, Recall, F1-score, Confusion Matrix
- 🌐 **Streamlit UI** for interactive experience
